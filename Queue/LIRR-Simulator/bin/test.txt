...//Much Later; we skipped a bunch of time steps

-------

//After a train has passed Mineola, write "Train X has stopped picking up passengers."

//These are sample stats and may not reflect the above simulation. Average wait time may be rounded to the nearest integer.

//Only consider passengers picked up by trains for average wait time. Count first class passengers sitting in second class as 1st class for stats

-------

At the end of the simulation:

A total of 63 passengers were served, 5 first class passengers were left without a seat, 9 second class passengers were left without a seat.

At Mineola 8 first class passengers were served with an average wait time of 19 min, 8 second class passengers were served with an average wait time of 23 min. 0 first class passengers and 0 second class passengers were left without a seat.

At Mineola 7 first class passengers were served with an average wait time of 13 min, 12 second class passengers were served with an average wait time of 16 min. 1 first class passengers and 0 second class passengers were left without a seat.

At Syosset 3 first class passengers were served with an average wait time of 8 min, 5 second class passengers were served with an average wait time of 8 min. 2 first class passengers and 3 second class passengers were left without a seat.

At Huntington 8 first class passengers were served with an average wait time of 1 min, 12 second class passengers were served with an average wait time of 2 min. 2 first class passengers and 6 second class passengers were left without a seat.//It's possible for passengers to arrive after the last train passes their station everywhere but the last station.
